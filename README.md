# Tiled-Historical-Maps
A repository of historical maps of LA for use on web pages

Old printed maps of Los Angeles cannot readily be used on modern web based applications. In many cases these maps are beautiful. In other cases they contain valuable information. This project allow those maps to be readily used on webpages.

These could be used with other MaptimeLA projects such as the [LA Historic Restaurant map](https://github.com/maptimeLA/old-la-restaurants).

The first series may be 1894 Sanborn maps. These hand drawn maps have detailed outlines of buildings and their uses along with identifying information for many buildings. The street names (and addresses) can help to understand the changes of street names and addresses.


Future maps may include 1888 Sanborn, 1921 Baist. Also many single page maps which can be done more easily.
