# Tiled-Historical-Maps
This is a project to learn how to [georeference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing) historic scanned maps with open sources tools to generate raster tiles for storytelling historical events and family histories in a neighborhood.

The skills developed here can be used on any scanned map or even a contempory drawing.

### Tools to be used:
* [Intro slideshow](https://maptimela.github.io/Tiled-Historical-Maps) to the workshop. [from this file](index.html)
* [QGIS](www.qgis.org).  An open source Geographic Information System
  * [Georeferencing steps for Sanborn maps](Georeferencing.md)
  * [Clipping](Clipping Steps.md)
  QGIS plugins to generate raster tiles using leaflet.
  * [QTiles] Better, but must use QGIS Development mode
  * [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) . Has problems 

### Maps to use:
* [Sanborn Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanborn_Maps)

### Sources:
We are using the downtown Los Angeles 1894-1900 scanned and downloaded from Proquest (Permissions to be obtained .
The Sanborn maps of LA for personal / non-commercial uses on web pages

## Background
Old printed maps of Los Angeles cannot readily be used on modern web based applications. In many cases these maps are beautiful. In other cases they contain valuable information. This project allow those maps to be readily used on webpages.

These could be used with other MaptimeLA projects such as the [LA Historic Restaurant map](https://github.com/maptimeLA/old-la-restaurants).

The first series may be 1894 Sanborn maps. These hand drawn maps have detailed outlines of buildings and their uses along with identifying information for many buildings. The street names (and addresses) can help to understand the changes of street names and addresses.

For more a [detailed discussion of Sanborn Maps on this site](Sandborn Maps).

Future maps may include 1888 Sanborn, 1921 Baist. Also many single page maps which can be done more easily. Or any map that you wish and even better if it contributes to the understanding of the culture and history of LA.

An example of what can be done with overlaying historical maps for [Istanbul, Turkey](http://www.istanbulurbandatabase.com/). This is one of hundreds of examples, just happened to pop up on a [blog](http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com "Maps Mania") when I was working on this page.
