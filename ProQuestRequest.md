Draft request to ProQuest

On behalf of MaptimeLA we would like to clarify or request permission to use Sanborn Map scans. MaptimeLA  is an open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge, offering intentional educational support for the beginner. We also hope to provide results that will be use to the community.

The particular project we would like to pursue is to make historical Sanborn maps available to use in web applications, much like Google Maps, but ours would be open source available to anyone to use.

Our understanding is that Sanborn maps previous to at least 1923 are in the public domain. Does that also apply to the scans provided by you to various libraries?
