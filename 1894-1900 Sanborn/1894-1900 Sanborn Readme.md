##  1894-1900 Sanborn map notes

Not all of the scans from the UCLA library were georeferenced. The georefenced ones are  usually GeoTIFFs (.tif). The non-referenced are JPGs.

Most sources list these as 1894-1900. Sanborn maps were updated by pasting on updated areas. So the underlying page (the Sanborns were bound books) was in this case 1894, the effective date is whenever the last revisions were made. So this should probably be labeled **1900 Sanborn**—presumably this 1894-1900 version has the 1900 updates. Difficult to tell from the scans since the paste-ons don't always show up.  UCB has a list of all known Sanborn maps and that should be consulted to confirm this.

-According to the [UCB Library](Earth Sciences & Map Library) [Sanborn maps](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/EART/sb_l.html#Los%20Angel) were issued in 1888, 1894 and 1906 for Los Angeles. The 1906 were updated until at least 1955 without a reprinting. Updates were done by pasting changes onto the existing pages. The previous link gives availably of scanned maps. The first date is the original bound book and the second date is when the last changes were made to that copy of the book. According to UCB the dates available are 1888, 1900, 1950, 1951 and 1925—nothing inbetween. What edition does the LAPL have in hard bound? Northridge has __hard copies__ of 1890 Vol 2 and 1894 Vols. 1, 2, and 3. They have others, but these are in the ones range of the current interest.

This 1894 Sanborn is labeled **Sanborn-Perris** on the key map and not just Sanborn as for 1888.

The Sanborn maps are colored to indicate certain features, but the available scans are black and white. The only hint of color is some dark areas.

The Sanborn maps are assembled in books and _spread_ across two pages (verso and recto in the book world). The available scans scan the verso and recto separately. Since these are bound, distortion is frequent at the binding; and sometimes the lighting is not too even. The scans in this collection are numbered with the map numbers (which are shown on the key map) and _a_ and _b_ for verso and recto. The TIFs are georeferenced, but the JPGs are not (that's what what available at UCLA) in 2016.

"1894" Volume Four is dated 1900 (in large type as well as the copyright date) and basically adds many areas to east and west of downtown. Also the address is changed from 115 Broadway, New York to 11 Broadway, New York. A bit of confusion results because some isolated areas that were included in the 1894 Volumes One, Two and Three that are now encompassed by Volume Four.

Fortunately their are only one set sheet numbers. Volume One has Sheets 1&ndash;39, Volume Two: ~51&ndash;~91, Volume Three: ~101&ndash;139 and Volume Four contains Sheets 140&ndash;~250. *Are the books different sizes; not consistent; and gaps in the number (reading from poor quality map, not a list).*


[Sanborn Maps at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanborn_Maps)

  <p>In sorting out the maps I realized what some sources label as 1888 Volume Two (text not digits were used, so following what's printed) is really an addendum to the 1888 edition that approximately doubled the number of sheets.  Sheets 1–40 from the 1888 were retained as is and retroactively made Volume 1. Other observations: 1) the "masthead" on the overview map is now <em>Sanborn-Perris Map Co.</em> while the 1888 version is <em>Sanborn Maps Publishing Co. Limited</em> (Ref below discusses 1899 change). 2) The 1888 overview map makes no mention of "Volumes," 3) the 1890 overview map is labeled "Volume 2", but it shows the sheet locations for both Volumes 1 and 2. There is no Volume 1. The address "117 Broadway, New York" is the same for both 1888 and 1890.
