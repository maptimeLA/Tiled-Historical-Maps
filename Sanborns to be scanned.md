###  First Sanborn Maps to Be Scanned for This Project

At present all publically available ones for Los Angeles are black and white and some are not high enough resolution to read all the information. Some states have  downloaded full-color and georeferenced scans, e.g.,  [Charlottesville, Virginia] (http://gis.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-SanbornCVL:1907map03)

#### Criteria and Background

-Since the period of interest is 1880 to 1930 concentrate on this period. Blais maps from 1920 are available so use Sanborn for earlier. Also information for early is more difficult to obtain. Nominally Sanborn are available for 1888 (first edition) and 1894 (three volumes). As other areas were added, new volumes were created with the date of publication identifying. For example, 1900 Volume Four adds new areas. But the first three volumes may never have been republished, just updated. What's confusing is that the volumes were updated by pasting in new information, and that should change the effective date, but hard to tell what the date of any given page is%mdash;depends on the person pasting in the information. And the catalogs of Sanborns online, don't seem to make it clear. **Find out the effective date of the CSUN collection**, i.e., what is the date of the latest paste up.

- But for this project we'll concentrate on the 1894 edition since it's in the middle of the more difficult period to cover. 

- Concentrate on downtown. Boyle Heights is of interest, but at a later period.

- We'll establish a priority since we don't know how many can be scanned. 

- First do the key maps, they show the approximate location of each sheet and have a "key" (legend) showing what various things mean on the individual sheets. Most of the sheets are scanned as two images (the left and right pages). The three volumes in black and white: 

![Volume One](/1894-1900 Sanborn/Volume_One/1894-1990 Georeferenced/0a.KeyWestFromTrimmed.tif "Vol 1 west"). Will want to pull the key out as a separate image, particularly since they may get trimmed off when the three key maps are merged. Having all three key maps will show almost all the streets, but none of the building information that is one the individual sheets

- Resolution. Virginia Sanborns are 3000 x 3000 pixels per sheet as rotatedâ€”unrotated might have been 2500x2100 (based on one I rotated back to square). Readable but has jaggies. Can imagine that double the resolutions would be cleaner. The problem is that the image will be rotated which increases the jaggies. **5000 pixels on a side would be good**. Can downsize later, but can't upsize later.

- Volume One contains Sheets 1 through 39, so volume number is listed below for easier tracking

- Note date of the page. Nice if can see paste ups

Some sheets cover non-contiguous areas or they aren't continuous [need a deisgntion for georef to track]

- Scans of any of the pages that indicate the update status

#### Priority of 1894 sheet scanning (Sanborn identifies one **sheet** as the left and right pages)

##### Volume One

-Almost all Volume One downtown maps are needed, but in a pinch *italicized* ones are less important

- Paranthetic notes are (just for reference)
